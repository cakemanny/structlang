This uses Atom from Ch.3 of C Interfaces and Implementations by David R. Hanson.
Table is based on the interface from the Table interface in Ch.8 of the same
book, but uses power of 2 sized tables and free space reuse based on some ideas
recalled from a talk by Cliff Click. https://youtu.be/HJ-719EGIts

The website for C Interfaces and Implementations can be found at
https://drh.github.io/cii/

The source code from that book is now released under MIT over at
https://github.com/drh/cii

I don't think this counts as a substantial portion of the software, so
I haven't copied across the MIT license text.
